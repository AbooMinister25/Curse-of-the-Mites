# Curse of the Mites

Curse of the Mites is a text based MUD (multi-user dungeon) in which you play as a caterpillar whose goal is to grow into a butterfly to escape the forest cursed by mites.

(Recommended reading to truly appreciate the nastiness of mites: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor)

Curse of the Mites has a server based off of `websockets`, and a TUI client written with the `textual` framework and `websockets` for communications.

All of the possible messages that can be sent and received between the client and the server correspond to pydantic schemas stored in the `/common` folder.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

- Python (3.10)
- Poetry
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Clone Repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AbooMinister25/Curse-of-the-Mites.git
```

### Install the game.

To install the server:
Enter the `/server` folder in your terminal and run:
```shell
poetry install
```

Same steps are required for the client (but you must enter the `/client` folder).

### Run Server

Make sure you are in the `/server` folder and run:

```shell
poetry run python3 main.py
```

### Run the client

Run the server before you attempt running the client.
Make sure you are in the `/client` folder and that whatever terminal you're using is full-screened. Then you can run:

```shell
poetry run python3 main.py
```

Multiple clients can be run and connected to the server at the same time.

## Gameplay

Curse of the Mites's (CotM) main objective is for you to gain enough XP to level up until you become a butterfly. XP is gained through killing mobs around the map. You control your caterpillar through the client's console.

The twist of the game is that the titular "curse" is brain scrambling! Each of your actions is actually mapped to a different action. For example: when you try to `!move north` you may end up moving south. Or when you try to `!sing` to your allies to heal them you'll spit and hurt them!

### Registering

Once you launch your client, you will be asked to register. All this consists of is you providing a username to go by while playing the game. You can register by using the `/register` command, followed by your username.

```
/register aboo
```
If you disconnect while playing the game your caterpillar's brain will be completely melted and it'll die (yes, you're a bad person).

### The console

This is a "console" within the console you're currently running your client in. It contains a space for you to type your commands in at the bottom and a log for you to receive information about the game on top.

Keep in mind that if you clicked outside of the console you'll have to click into it in order to type.

You can type in `/help` to receive help about your available commands.

### The Map

The map is shown above your console, and lists all players and your current position. Your character will be marked by a yellow `@` sign, while other players will be marked by a blue one. You will not be able to see mobs, and the console will notify you if you encounter one.

Each "tile" of the map corresponds to a room, you must be in the same room as other entities in order to interact with them.

### Time

"Time" in this game happens every 6 seconds! Which means after each round every player will have a 6 second interval to decide what they wish to do next. Once time "ticks" the next queued move of every player will be used.

### Actions

You can see all of the actions you have available in the bottom right corner of your console.
There are two main type of actions, movement and "spells":

#### Movement
Movement is done through the `!move` command, followed by whatever direction you wish to move in (one of north, east, south, west). For example: `!move north`.

You can also use numbers to move the following way (this type of movement is intended to be done with the numpad):
```
         (north?)
            8
            ↑
(west?) 4 ← . → 6 (east?)
            ↓
            2
         (south?)
```
Once you start fighting with mobs you cannot move! If you really want to get out of there you'll have to try `!flee`ing.

#### Spells
Spells are your way of affecting the health of other entities and yourself. There are targeted attacks and heals, AOE attacks and heals (not targeted) and self heals (not targeted).

When your brain is scrambled, targeted spells will be mapped to other targeted spells and the same will happen with no-target spells.

AOE (area of effect) spells will affect every entity in the room other than the caster. Keep in mind that they can be very powerful but you may harm your fellow players and heal your enemies with them!

To try casting a spell simply do `!(name of the spell)` or `!(name of the spell) (name of the target)` if the spell is targeted. You can see the names of the entities you can target in the top right corner of the console.

#### Special actions
There are three special actions that do not get scrambled:

`!nvm`: removes the last action you entered from your action queue.

`!clear`: removes every action from your action queue.

`!flee`: allows you to abandon a combat and move (keep in mind that it has a chance of failing!).

### Combat strategy

Enemies can have a lot of health and they can even regenerate it. It's encouraged that you team up with other "players" instead of fighting solo since combat will be much more entertaining and faster paced!

### The action queue
Each time you type in an action command, this action gets added to your caterpillar's action queue. This allows you to "prepare" moves for next rounds.

For example (let's assume your moves aren't scrambled), if you type `!move north`, `!move east`, `!sing` in quick succession: next round your caterpillar will move north, 6 seconds after that it'll move east and after another 6 seconds it will sing.

### Chatting
Anything other than a valid action that you type will be treated as chatting. Chatting is instantaneous and every other player in the server will be able to read what you said.

# Design decisions

## Technical decisions

### Communications

Both the server and the client utilize the `websockets` library to send and receive all of their messages.

Both in the client and the server we have decided to have a single "message handler". This is to avoid problems with two points of the program trying to `recv` messages at the same time which leads to a `websockets` exception. This also ensures that we can receive messages at almost any point of the runtime, since trying to create specific windows of time when only specific messages can be received can lead to unexpected bugs.

The only exception to this rule is the initialization of a client. Since most other actions require the client to have a caterpillar, we must make sure that the first message the server receives from a new client is a `register` message.

The structure of all possible messages to be sent and received is given by pydantic models in `/common/schemas.py`. The sender must build a valid message using one of these models, and the receiver can deserialize it using the functions from `/common/deserialize.py`.

Our message handlers utilize pattern matching to easily handle each kind of message (example from `/client/main.py`):
```py
event = deserialize_server_response(json.loads(message))
match event:
    case ChatMessage():
        self.console_widget.out.add_log(
            f"{event.player_name}: {event.chat_message}"
        )
    case RegistrationSuccessful():
        self.initialized = True
        self.name = event.player.name
        ...
```

Normally the server immediately tries to respond to the client after receiving a message, this is because we want the player to have some form of immediate feedback of their action having been processed (e.g: `Added action to queue`).

Once a turn has passed, after the player already received some immediate feedback, the server will send the client information about the results of their actions and other relevant actions that were effectuated by other entities.
